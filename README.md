# cv_ray_tracer
Literally the best Ray Tracer in town (at the time).
This project was developed in the Visual Computing lab class. It aims to implement a simple ray tracing algorithm in webGL. 

The algorithm will cast a ray for each pixel, compute its reflections and calculate the resulting color of the surfaces that the reflections collided

This project accomplishes two goals:

1. Each ray is drawn in the screen to show the algorithm's ray casting behavior.
2. The resulting colors are drawn in small circles aside.
